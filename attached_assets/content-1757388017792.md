### Our Mandate

At WSGI, we walk with women through every season of life supporting, strengthening, and equipping them to become all that God has called them to be.

Through Mothers of Nations, we create a sacred space for women believing for the fruit of the womb. Here, miracle pregnancies are not just hoped for they are celebrated. In WSGI Singles, single women and men are surrounded with intentional prayer and purpose as they trust God for covenant marriages and cultivate hearts of purity.

### Outreach Missions

Beloved sister, this is where prayer rolls up its sleeves. To the widow straining to feed her children we bring groceries wrapped in prayers. To the orphan wearing yesterday’s uniform we give shoes lined with hope. To the woman whispering, "Does God see me?" we become His "Yes" in flesh and blood. This is faith that feeds before it preaches, that holds before it teaches. Because love isn’t love until it crosses the street. "True worship is to care for orphans and widows in their distress." – James 1:27
